### <h1> Brain Tumor Identification from MRI images</h1>

<ul>
<li>I have used PyTorch for this project</li>
<li>The dataset containg MRI images of healthy and brains with tumor. </li>
<li>So , from the given dataset, i am done data augmented to expand and deepen my original dataset.</li>
<li>I have built this project using <b>ResNet-18</b> architecture to resolve the <b>vanishing gradient problem</b>.</li>
<li>I have attained a test accuracy of <b>93.4%</b> for training for <b>11 epochs</b> </li>
